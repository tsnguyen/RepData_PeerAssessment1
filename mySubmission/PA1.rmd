## Loading and preprocessing the data
First, read the data in
```{r input}
data <- read.csv("activity.csv", colClasses = c("numeric", "factor", "numeric"))
nrow(data)
```
and then clean it up
```{r cleanup}
data <- data[complete.cases(data),]
nrow(data)
```
## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
We can aggregate the data by date
```{r aggregate}
aggregatedata <- aggregate(data$steps, by = list(data$date), FUN = sum)
head(aggregatedata )
nrow(aggregatedata)
```
The histogram of the number of steps per day is
```{r hist1}
with(aggregatedata, hist(x))
```

The mean and median
```{r MeanAndMedian}
mean(aggregatedata$x)
median(aggregatedata$x)
```

## What is the average daily activity pattern?

## Imputing missing values

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
